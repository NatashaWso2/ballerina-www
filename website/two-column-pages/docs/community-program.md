Following is the quick tour for you to follow and experience Ballerina.


## Install Ballerina

1. Go to [https://ballerina.io/downloads](https://ballerina.io/downloads).
2. Download current stable version of Ballerina for your operating system.
3. Follow the instructions given in [https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/#installing-ballerina](https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/#installing-ballerina) to set it up.

### Verify Installation

To check if the installation is done right, run the following command.

```ballerina -v ```

This should print the version of Ballerina you have installed.

``` Ballerina 0.990.0 ```

## Hello World with Ballerina

While you can implement a simple program with Ballerina in isolation, the best practice is to start a project with the `ballerina init` command.

<ol>
<li>Start your project by creating a new folder of your choice.
</li>
<li>Navigate to that folder on command line and run the following command.
<code>ballerina init </code>
You see a response confirming that your project is initialized.
<code> Ballerina project initialized </code>
This automatically creates a typical Hello World service for you.
</li>
<li>Start the service using the `ballerina run` command.
ballerina run hello_service.bal
You get the following output.
<code> Initiating service(s) in 'hello_service.bal'
ballerina: started HTTP/WS endpoint 0.0.0.0:9090 </code>
</li>
<li>Open a new command line to invoke the service using a HTTP client program such as cURL.</li>
<li>Invoke the service using an HTTP client.
  
<code> curl http://localhost:9090/hello/sayHello </code>

Tip: If you do not have cURL installed, you can download it from <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html">https://curl.haxx.se/download.html</a>.

You get the following response.
<code>Hello Ballerina! </code></li>
</ol>

You just created a Ballerina project, started a service, invoked that service, and received a response.

## Hello World Client

Instead of using an HTTP client program such as cURL, you can implement a client program to invoke the service using Ballerina itself.





<ol>
<li>
Open a new command line and go to the same folder you created the service.
</li>

<li>
Create a new file named main.bal.
</li>

<li>
Edit the main.bal file using a text editor of your choice.
</li>

<li>
Copy and paste the following code into the file and save the file.
</li>

</ol>

``` ballerina
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/log;
import ballerina/io;

http:Client clientEndpoint = new("http://localhost:9090");

public function main() {
    // Send a GET request to the Hello World service endpoint.
    var response = clientEndpoint->get("/hello/sayHello");
    if (response is http:Response) {
        io:println(response.getTextPayload());
    } else {
        log:printError("Get request failed", err = response);
    }
}
```
<ol start="5">
<li>Go back to the command line where you created the main.bal file.</li>
<li>Make sure your hello_service.bal is running in another command line (note that we started this service before and did not stop it). If it is not running, you can run it again in a new command line with
<code> ballerina run hello_service.bal</code>.</li>
<li>
Run the main.bal file.

<code>ballerina run main.bal</code>

This will invoke the print the response

<code>Hello Ballerina!</code>

You just invoked the Hello World service written in Ballerina programming language using a client program written in Ballerina.
</li>
<li>Shut down the service. To do this, go to the command line where you ran the service and press ctrl+c keys together.
</li>
</ol>



## Create a New Module

1. Right click on the folder name that you opened as your project, and click on **New Folder**.
2. Name the folder **calculator**. This means that you are going to implement a Ballerina module named calculator.
3. Right click on the **calculator** folder and click on **New File**.
4. Name the new file **lib.bal**.
5. Double click on the **lib.bal** file to open the file. We will have the implementation of the calculator functions of add, subtract, multiply and divide in this lib.bal file.
6. Copy the following code and paste into the **lib.bal** file and save it.
``` ballerina
function add(float a, float b) returns (float) {
    return a + b;
}

function subtract(float a, float b) returns (float) {
    return a - b;
}

function multiply(float a, float b) returns (float) {
    return a * b;
}

function divide(float a, float b) returns (float) {
    return a / b;
}
```

<ol start="7">
<li>Right click on <b>calculator</b> folder and click on <b>New File</b>.</li>
<li>Name the new file <b>main.bal</b>.</li>
<li>Double click on the <b>main.bal</b> file to open the file.
We will have the implementation main function that implements the calculator in this file.
The main program goes in a loop and executes calculator operations until the user chooses to exit.
Only add and subtract functions are used in the sample implementation. You can implement multiply and divide operations in this sample on your own and test.</li>
  <li>Copy the following code and paste it into the <b>main.bal</b> file and save it.</li>
</ol>

``` ballerina
import ballerina/io;

public function main() {

    int operation = 0;
    while (operation != 5) {
        // print options menu to choose from
        io:println("Select operation.");
        io:println("1. Add");
        io:println("2. Subtract");
        io:println("3. Multiply");
        io:println("4. Divide");
        io:println("5. Exit");

        // read user's choice
        string val = io:readln("Enter choice 1 - 5: ");
        var choice = int.convert(val);
        if (choice is int) {
            operation = choice;
        } else {
            io:println("Invalid choice \n");
            continue;
        }

        if (operation == 5) {
            break;
        } else if (operation < 1 || operation > 5) {
            io:println("Invalid choice \n");
            continue;
        }

        // Read two numbers from user to be used for calculator operations
        var input1 = io:readln("Enter first number: ");
        var num1 = float.convert(input1);
        float firstNumber = 0;
        if (num1 is float) {
            firstNumber = num1;
        } else {
            io:println("Invalid first number \n");
            continue;
        }
        var input2 = io:readln("Enter second number: ");
        var num2 = float.convert(input2);
        float secondNumber = 0;
        if (num2 is float) {
            secondNumber = num2;
        } else {
            io:println("Invalid second number \n");
            continue;
        }
        // Execute calculator operations based on user's choice
        if (operation == 1) {
            io:print("Addition result: ");
            io:println(add(firstNumber, secondNumber));
        } else if (operation == 2) {
            io:print("Subtraction result: ");
            io:println(subtract(firstNumber, secondNumber));
        } else if (operation == 3) {
            io:print("Multiplication result: ");
            io:println(multiply(firstNumber, secondNumber));
        } else if (operation == 4) {
            io:print("Division result: ");
            io:println(divide(firstNumber, secondNumber));
        }
    }
}

```
<ol start="11">
<li>Go back to the command line where you created the project. This is the parent folder of the calculator folder.</li>
<li>Run the program on the command line using the following command:
  
<code> ballerina run calculator </code>

This will run the calculator moduleâ€™s main program interactively until you choose to quit with 5 as input.</li>
<li>Enter 1 as input, then enter two numbers to add and see the result. You may also test the subtract option.</li>
<li>Quit the main program by entering 5 as input.</li>
</ol>

## Create a Calculator Service

1. Right click on the **calculator** folder and click **New File**.
2. Name the new file **service.bal**.
3. Double click on the **service.bal** file.
We will have a REST service that provides a calculator service in this file.
The service takes in a JSON requests that provides the inputs to calculate on and the operation to execute.
This service only implements the add operation. You may extend this and implement the other operations as an exercise on your own.
4. Copy the following code and paste it into the **service.bal** file and save it.

``` ballerina
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/log;

listener http:Listener httpListener = new(9090);

// Calculator REST service
@http:ServiceConfig { basePath: "/calculator" }
service Calculator on httpListener {

    // Resource that handles the HTTP POST requests that are directed to
    // the path `/operation` to execute a given calculate operation
    // Sample requests for add operation in JSON format
    // `{ "firstNumber": 10, "secondNumber":  200, "operation": "add"}`
    // `{ "firstNumber": 10, "secondNumber":  20.0, "operation": "+"}`

    @http:ResourceConfig {
        methods: ["POST"],
        path: "/operation"
    }
    resource function executeOperation(http:Caller caller, http:Request req) {
        var operationReq = req.getJsonPayload();
        http:Response errResp = new;
        errResp.statusCode = 500;
        if (operationReq is json) {
            string operation = operationReq.operation.toString();

            any result = 0.0;
            // Pick first number for the calculate operation from the JSON request
            float firstNumber = 0.0;
            var input = float.convert(operationReq.firstNumber);
            if (input is float) {
                firstNumber = input;
            } else {
                errResp.setJsonPayload({"^error":"Invalid first number"});
                var err = caller->respond(errResp);
                handleResponseError(err);
                return;
            }

            // Pick second number for the calculate operation from the JSON request
            float secondNumber = 0.0;
            input = float.convert(operationReq.secondNumber);
            if (input is float) {
                secondNumber = input;
            } else {
                errResp.setJsonPayload({"^error":"Invalid second number"});
                var err = caller->respond(errResp);
                handleResponseError(err);
                return;
            }

            if(operation == "add" || operation == "+") {
                result = add(firstNumber, secondNumber);
            }

            // Create response message.
            json payload = { status: "Result of " + operation, result: <float>result };

            // Send response to the client.
            var err = caller->respond(untaint payload);
            handleResponseError(err);
        } else {
            errResp.setJsonPayload({"^error":"Request payload should be a json."});
            var err = caller->respond(errResp);
            handleResponseError(err);
        }
    }
}

function handleResponseError(error? err) {
    if (err is error) {
        log:printError("Respond failed", err = err);
    }
}

```



<ol start="5">
<li>Go back to the command line where you created the project. This is the parent folder of the calculator folder.   </li>
<li>Run the service on the command line using the following command:
  
<code> ballerina run calculator </code>
Inside the calculator module, you now have both a main program that you previously wrote and the service that you just wrote.
When Ballerina is run for the calculator module, the main program is run, and the service is started.</li>
<li>Open a new command line to invoke the service using an HTTP client program such as cURL.</li>
<li>Invoke the service using an HTTP client.
<code> curl -v -X POST -d '{"firstNumber": 10.21, "secondNumber":  200.1, "operation": "add"}' "http://localhost:9090/calculator/operation" -H "Content-Type:application/json" </code>
</li>
</ol>

## Create a Client for Calculator Service

1. Right click on the module folder, that is the root folder that contains the **calculator** folder and click on **New File**.
2. Name the new file **client.bal**.
3. Double click on the **client.bal** file.
We will have the implementation a REST client to invoke calculator service in this file.
The client sends a JSON request that provides the input to calculate on and the operation (in this case, we execute the add operation) to execute to calculator service, receives the result and prints that.
4. Copy the following code and paste it into the **client.bal** file and save it.
5. Before going ahead, delete **main.bal** from the module folder if it still exists.

``` ballerina
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/io;
import ballerina/log;

http:Client clientEndpoint = new("http://localhost:9090");

public function main() {

    http:Request req = new;

    // Set the JSON payload to the message to be sent to the endpoint.
    json jsonMsg = { firstNumber: 15.6, secondNumber: 18.9, operation: "add" };
    req.setJsonPayload(jsonMsg);

    var response = clientEndpoint->post("/calculator/operation", req);
    if (response is http:Response) {
        var msg = response.getJsonPayload();
        if (msg is json) {
                string resultMessage = "Addition result "
                    + jsonMsg["firstNumber"].toString() + " + "
                    + jsonMsg["secondNumber"].toString() + " : "
                    + msg["result"].toString();
                io:println(resultMessage);
            } else {
                log:printError("Response is not json", err = msg);
            }
    } else {
        log:printError("Invalid response", err = response);
    }
}

```

<ol start="6">
<li>Open a new command line to invoke the client program. Go to the project root folder, which is the parent folder of the calculator folder.</li>
<li>Run the client program to invoke the calculator service.
  
<code> ballerina run client.bal </code>

This will invoke the service, and print the result
<code> Addition result 15.6 + 18.9 : 34.5 </code>
</li>
</ol>

## Push your Module to Ballerina Central

Visit [https://central.ballerina.io/](https://central.ballerina.io/) and sign up. You can click **Sign Up** action on the top right corner of the website and use an existing Google account or a GitHub account of yours to sign up.

Once you sign up, you will be asked to create an organization for you on [https://central.ballerina.io/create-organization](https://central.ballerina.io/create-organization). You may use your name or another name of your choice as the organization name.

Once you create an organization, you will be taken to your dashboard [https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard](https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard). There you can find your Ballerina token to access the Ballerina Central site from your computer to push modules. The `ballerina push` command uploads your module into Ballerina Central so that you can share your module with other developers.

For the `ballerina push` command to work, you need to copy and paste your Ballerina Central access token into `Settings.toml` in your home repository `<USER_HOME>/.ballerina/`. To do this, click on the copy button in front of the text box displaying the token on your Ballerina Central dashboard. Then go to your user home on a command line and go into the .ballerina folder and paste the token you copied into a file with the name Settings.toml. Since you are a new user, there would not be such file in there already, so you will have to create on in there.

When you push a module to Ballerina Central, the runtime validates organization name you have on Ballerina Cantal for the user against the `org-name` defined in your projectâ€™s `Ballerina.toml` file. You need to add organization name into this file.
To do this, go to the folder where you created your calculator module. Then create a file with the name Ballerina.toml and add in there the following. Note that this file in not within the calculator folder, but rather outside that at the same level of calculator folder (which is also referred to as Ballerina project home) You may also use the composer to create a new file, name that Ballerina.toml and add the following content using composer.

```
[project]
org-name = "sami"
version = "0.1.0"
```

You also need to have a Module.md file inside your module that describes the module before you push the module into Ballerina Central.

You can either create this on command line or using composer, right click on calculator folder select New File and name that to Module.md. Add some meaningful content to help document the module in this file.

For example

Example calculator module.

```
Contains basic arithmetic operations
(add, subtract, multiply, divide)
a sample menu driven main program to test, and a
sample REST service with JSON input/output to
invoke calculator as a service
```

Now you can push the module to Ballerina Central. The `push` command will do a build of the module before pushing the module to Ballerina Central.

``` ballerina push calculator ```

You will get a confirmation message similar to the following.

``` <org-name>/calculator:0.1.0 [project repo -> central] ```

Now you can go to your dashboard on Ballerina Central and view the module
[https://central.ballerina.io/manage-organization#modules](https://central.ballerina.io/manage-organization#modules)

You may also go to the module landing page directly to view the module details. Make sure to replace <org-name> with your organization name in the following URL
[https://central.ballerina.io/<org-name>/calculator](https://central.ballerina.io/<org-name>/calculator)

## Follow the Repo

<div class="cGitButtonContainer"><p data-button="iGitStarText">"Star"</p> <p data-button="iGitWatchText">"Watch"</p></div>

Ballerina source repository lives on GitHub.

You can view the source repo at [https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang).

It is a good community practice to star a GitHub repository and show appreciation to maintainers of a project for their work. You may star Ballerina project on GitHub.

To, do this, you need a GitHub account. If you do not have one already, visit the following URL and follow the instructions given in the form and create a GitHub account for you.
[https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
(**Note**: You do not need to follow step 2 and 3 in the GitHub join process as those are optional)

Now visit
[https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/stargazers](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/stargazers)
Click on the **Star** button at the top right corner just below the dark site header. If successfully done, **Star** will change to **Unstar**.

You may also click the **Watch** button that appears to the left of the **Star** action. Watching the repo will help you keep track of Ballerina issues. If successfully done, **Watch** will change to **Unwatch**.

## Clean Up and Wrap Up

Congratulations!

You have just finished your first project with Ballerina programming language.

If you wish to uninstall Ballerina, you may follow instructions in [https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/#uninstalling-ballerina](https://ballerina.io/learn/getting-started/#uninstalling-ballerina)
